# Welcome to the Bee Movie Script Prank!

This was used without malicious use in mind, please consider use before use.

## How to Use?

To run the prank, follow these steps:

1. **Ensure Python is Installed:**
   Before you can run the script, make sure you have Python installed on your system. If it's not installed, download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Install Required Libraries:**
   This project uses the Selenium library to simulate web interactions, so you need to install it first. Open your command prompt or terminal and install Selenium using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install selenium

3. **Run the code**
    run command line as admin (or not, I'm not sure) and change your directory to the folder with app.py // once you do this, run the code by entering: python app.py
